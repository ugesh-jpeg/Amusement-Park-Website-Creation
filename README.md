78 Theme Park Website Project
Purpose:
The website aims to market the park, provide visitor info, enable ticketing, and enhance guest experience. It targets potential visitors, event planners, current guests, media, and more.

Theme Park Concept:
"78 Theme Park" offers attractions like roller coasters, ferris wheels, and pirate ship rides, alongside VIP experiences, food, shops, and visitor support.

Research & Design Insights:
We analyzed five major theme park websites (e.g., Universal Studios Singapore, Disneyland Tokyo) to understand best practices. Highlights include strong navigation, FAQs, maps, and real-time info. Poor layout and lack of homepage engagement were noted as issues to avoid.

Site Structure (3 Pages):

Main Page: Overview, featured ride, ticket booking, programmes, FAQs, map & transport info

Attractions Page: Map view with interactive highlights, ride info, ticket options, parking, policies

Shop Page: Tabs for restaurants and shops, event promos, slideshow displays, rewards sign-up

Design Approach:
Responsive wireframes were created for both desktop and mobile, with a consistent navigation bar and interactive UI elements like hover effects and slideshows.
